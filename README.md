Easily Organize, Sort Through, and Load your Kontakt NKI/NKM Files in Windows

This project was built to satisfy a need to have a separate app to manage a large Kontakt files collection.

This app does not delete/move/rename/etc. your files, but it will make management of your files a lot easier.


<b>Features Include:</b>
- Advanced Searching/sorting
- Deduplication (for example, when you have more than one copy of a library but you only want results from faster storage)
- Give instruments their own 1-5 star rating
- Add your own tags/notes for one or more instruments/multis
- Mark items as not working (in case of file corruption or other issues)
- Easily navigate to the folder containing your instruments


<b>Getting Started:</b>
- Drag-and-drop files/folders into this app from your computer at any time to add to your index.  If you drag in the same file(s) twice, it won't be re-added.
- Drag-and-drop your NKI/NKM file(s) directly into Kontakt from this app
